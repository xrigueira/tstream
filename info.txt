LSTMS work with fixed intervals and usually do not look back more than 1 year. In our case
this is a problem because the watershed has memory that spans more than a year. Here a transformer
comes in handy because it is able to take into account information from more than a year ago.
Additionally it can work with nonuniform time distances.

LSTMs process tokens sequentially This architecture maintains a hidden state that is updated 
with every new input token, representing the entire sequence it has seen. Theoretically, very 
important information can propagate over infinitely long sequences. However, in practice, this 
it not the case. Due to the vanishing gradient problem, the LSTM will eventually forget earlier tokens.

In comparison, Transformers retain direct connections to all previous timestamps, allowing 
information  to propagate over much longer sequences. However, this entails a new challenge: 
the model will be directly connected to an exploding amount of input. In order to filter the 
important from the unimportant, Transformers use an algorithm called self-attention.

The mathematical summary would to find the function f such that:
	Q_{t+1} = f(X_{t}, X_{t-1}, \dots, X_{t-n})
Where Q is the stream flow in mm (because they divided discharge by the area of the water shed),
and X is the snow output from the model: snow melted + precipitation.
Q starts on October 2nd 1980, while X starts on October 1st, 1980

When it comes to the train, test, and pred sets I have to do the following division in water years:
	training: 1980 - 2006
	testing/dev: 2006 - 2008
	prediction: 2008 - end (2022)

A good start (vanilla version) would be to use a uniform time step from a past series to predict the next step.
(Maybe only with precipitation to begin).

Then multistep resolution: Use averages per month when we train on data far from the prediction point but increase
to daily when we are getting closer to that point.

Autoformer: https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer
FEDformer: https://github.com/MAZiqing/FEDformer
FEDformer is probably better for long sequence prediction tasks, 
as the authors state in the paper when they compare it with th Autoformer.
